I combined my theoretical knowlegde that I gained throught my industiral
engineering education with the pratical knowledge I gained during my
intenships. I reinforced my computer skills by doing research to improve
myself. As a curious, open to learning, and enthusiastic person, I think that I
will add value to your company while working and at the same tme contribute
to my skills and knowledge.
